# Rational Hues for K = 3, 4, 5

Generated from RGB simplex points r+g+b = K with integer coordinates.

## K = 3

Distinct hue angles (degrees):

0, 30, 90, 120, 150, 210, 240, 270, 330

H_3 = 9

Gaps (cyclic, degrees):

30, 60, 30, 30, 60, 30, 30, 60, 30

Δ_min = 30°, Δ_max = 60°, mean = 360/9 ≈ 40.0°
