FARD 1.0 TRACE VOCABULARY AND SCHEMAS (SPEC ARTIFACT)

SCOPE
This document freezes the trace vocabulary and per-kind schemas already enforced by the M2 trace gates and associated verifier logic.

NORMATIVE NOTE
The authoritative vocabulary is the runtime verifier source. This file is frozen text, but must be kept byte-aligned with the verifier-defined vocabulary and per-kind keysets.

TRACE LINE CANONICAL SHAPE (FROZEN)
Each trace line is one canonical JSON object, single-line, newline-terminated.
Canonical JSON means:
- Deterministic key ordering as enforced by the canon gate
- No extra keys beyond the schema for that kind
- Stable ordering constraints across kinds as enforced by the ordering gate

COMMON REQUIRED KEYS (FROZEN)
Every trace event record includes:
- t : string (event kind tag)
- Additional keys depend on t

VOCABULARY (FROZEN)
The set of allowed t values is enforced by the trace vocabulary gate.

PER-KIND SCHEMAS (FROZEN)
For each allowed t, the exact keyset and value-type constraints are enforced by the trace schema gate.

HOW TO REFREEZE FROM CODE (MECHANICAL)
Run: bash tools/freeze_trace_vocab_and_schemas.sh
This tool extracts the current authoritative vocabulary and schema text from the verifier sources into this spec file.
